# Provider architecture

> For maintainers. Using AgentTunnel? See [docs/user](../user/).

A provider is the agent runtime that does the actual work. AgentTunnel supports several, and the
orchestration layer does not know which one is behind a thread.

## Built-in drivers

[`builtInDrivers.ts`][drivers] exports `BUILT_IN_DRIVERS` with six entries:

| Driver kind   | Driver source                                 |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `codex`       | [`Drivers/CodexDriver.ts`][codex]             |
| `claudeAgent` | [`Drivers/ClaudeDriver.ts`][claude]           |
| `cursor`      | [`Drivers/CursorDriver.ts`][cursor]           |
| `grok`        | [`Drivers/GrokDriver.ts`][grok]               |
| `opencode`    | [`Drivers/OpenCodeDriver.ts`][opencode]       |
| `agenttunnel` | [`Drivers/AgentTunnelDriver.ts`][agenttunnel] |

Each driver declares its `driverKind`, a `configSchema`, and a `create` function that builds an
adapter in a child scope. Adapter implementations live beside them in
`apps/server/src/provider/Layers/` (`CodexAdapter.ts`, `ClaudeAdapter.ts`, and so on) and conform to
[`ProviderAdapter.ts`][adapter]. Read the driver plus its adapter to see how a specific agent's
transport, config, and event shapes are mapped.

## Registry and routing

Two registries separate configuration from live processes:

- [`ProviderInstanceRegistry`][instances] keys configured instances by `ProviderInstanceId`. Creating
  one looks up the driver by `driverKind`, decodes `entry.config` with that driver's schema, opens a
  child scope, and calls `driver.create`.
- [`ProviderAdapterRegistry`][registry] resolves an instance ID to its live adapter via
  `getByInstance`.

[`ProviderService`][service] sits on top. It combines the adapter registry with the provider session
directory to route session and turn operations for a thread, so callers name a thread, not an agent.

Adding a driver means writing the driver plus adapter and adding it to `BUILT_IN_DRIVERS`. No
orchestration, contract, or client change is required for the common case.

## OpenCode server ownership and catalog

Each OpenCode provider instance owns one lazy local server for catalog discovery and
text-generation helpers through [`OpenCodeServerOwner.ts`][opencode-server-owner]. Concurrent
borrowers share startup. The server closes 30 seconds after the last borrower releases it, or
when the provider instance closes. A failed or exited process can be started again on the next
use. An externally configured OpenCode server remains externally owned.

The local server and its SDK clients use one resolved password. An explicit provider password
overrides `OPENCODE_SERVER_PASSWORD` in the spawned environment. Without an explicit password,
the client uses the password from the environment that the process inherits. External servers use
only their explicit provider password and never inherit the host's local password.

Every server connection must pass the authenticated `/global/health` check before inventory or
session operations start. The response must contain a valid version at or above 1.14.19. Local
owners cache this result for the lifetime of the spawned process. External actions check once when
they create their server connection, not for each model or SDK request.

Chat adapters keep their own server per thread. They register a thread-specific `t3-code` MCP
connection, while OpenCode stores MCP connections by directory. Sharing these chat servers
without changing MCP routing would let two threads in one directory replace each other's
connection.

OpenCode loads its catalog through the HTTP API when an enabled provider instance starts. The
provider registry keeps the snapshot in memory and persists it in the existing per-instance cache.
Each `subscribeServerConfig` connection refreshes all providers, so a client reconnect reloads the
OpenCode catalog from the current helper. The `serverRefreshProviders` request also refreshes it.
Periodic OpenCode probes remain disabled. OpenCode reads credentials for each inventory request,
but its native configuration files can remain cached for the lifetime of the helper process. The
helper closes 30 seconds after its last inventory or text-generation borrower releases it. A
refresh after that idle period starts a new helper and reads file changes. Repeated refreshes and
active text-generation work can extend process reuse. Changes to the provider configuration or
environment replace the instance and start a new discovery. Changes to unrelated settings only
update snapshot enrichment. Other providers retain their existing refresh policy.

AgentTunnel does not own an external OpenCode process. Native configuration changes there can require
an external reload or restart before AgentTunnel's next refresh sees them.

The shared server's idle shutdown does not clear the catalog. Failed discovery keeps the last
known models, slash commands, and skills through the registry's existing merge rules. A successful
empty inventory is authoritative. Existing threads keep their explicit model identifier and
options when catalog metadata is missing; the catalog is not permission to choose a different
model for a thread.

## Model manifest

The model picker's legacy section is driven by `apps/server/src/provider/model-manifest.json`, which
lists the current (non-legacy) model slugs per driver kind. The `ModelManifest` service
(`apps/server/src/provider/ModelManifest.ts`) refreshes that data from the same file on `main` via
raw.githubusercontent.com, so moving a model in or out of the legacy section is a commit, not a
release. Preference order is remote fetch, then the on-disk copy of the last successful fetch (in
the state directory), then the bundled copy. Fetches are TTL-gated, run concurrently with provider
probes, respect the `enableProviderUpdateChecks` setting, and never fail a provider check. The
Codex and Claude drivers apply the classification to every snapshot with `applyModelManifest`;
driver kinds absent from the manifest have no legacy concept.

## AgentTunnel workflow driver

`agenttunnel` presents one AgentTunnel thread as a workflow coordinator. Its server-side adapter launches an
orchestrator CLI process, parses `__AGENTTUNNEL_TOOL__` actions, and schedules executor/reviewer CLI
processes in named pipelines. Pipelines can run in parallel, run sequentially, or wait on other
pipelines. The adapter maps the workflow coordinator to a `local_workflow` task and each child to a
`local_agent` task with `parentAgentId`, phase metadata, progress, and terminal status. The existing
chat timeline and Agents panel therefore render the workflow without a client-specific transport.

AgentTunnel is enabled by default and is the primary provider for fresh installations; the other
built-in providers are opt-in. Configure the orchestrator, executor, and reviewer harness paths in
provider settings. The default harness is `opencode` for all three roles. AgentTunnel child sessions
are currently non-interactive and use the configured permission-bypass setting; approval and user-input
requests are not yet routed through the AgentTunnel request surface.

## How provider work is requested

Clients never call a provider directly. They dispatch orchestration commands over the RPC method
`orchestration.dispatchCommand`, defined with the rest of the orchestration surface in
[`orchestration.ts`][contracts]. The client-dispatchable provider-facing commands are
`thread.turn.start`, `thread.turn.interrupt`, `thread.approval.respond`,
`thread.user-input.respond`, `thread.checkpoint.revert`, and `thread.session.stop`, plus the mode
setters `thread.runtime-mode.set` and `thread.interaction-mode.set`.

The engine persists an event for the command, and a server-side reactor performs the provider call.
Provider output comes back as internal commands such as `thread.message.assistant.delta` and
`thread.session.set`, which clients observe through `orchestration.subscribeThread`. See
[overview.md](./overview.md) for the command/event loop.

## Server-side workers

Provider work flows through three queue-backed workers. All three are built with
`makeDrainableWorker` from [`DrainableWorker.ts`][worker] and expose `drain` for deterministic test
synchronization.

1. [`ProviderRuntimeIngestion`][ingest] consumes provider runtime streams and emits orchestration
   commands.
2. [`ProviderCommandReactor`][cmd] reacts to orchestration intent events and dispatches provider
   calls.
3. [`CheckpointReactor`][checkpoint] captures workspace checkpoints on turn start and completion, and
   performs reverts.

### Buffered assistant delivery

A thread in `buffered` assistant delivery mode accumulates assistant text instead of streaming each
delta. The buffer is not held until turn completion. In [`ProviderRuntimeIngestion`][ingest],
`MAX_BUFFERED_ASSISTANT_CHARS` is 24,000: the append that would exceed it invalidates the buffer and
spills the whole accumulated text as one delta. The buffer also flushes at interaction boundaries,
when a request opens (approval) or user input is requested, via
`flushBufferedAssistantMessagesForTurn`.
